The IU Non-Food Project is designed to provide a comparative analysis of non-food item usage in outlets, comparing the quantities and costs of items used in the last month (H-1) versus two months ago (H-2). 



The project will focus on the following key data points for each outlet:

-Item Name            : The name of the non-food item used.

-Item Code            : A unique identifier for the item.

-Category Name        : The specific category to which the item belongs (e.g., cleaning supplies, packaging, etc.).

-UOM (Unit of Measure): The measurement unit used for the item (e.g., pieces, liters, etc.).

-Unit Price           : The cost per unit of the item.

-Quantity Used (Qty)  : The total amount of the item consumed by the outlet for the respective month (H-1 and H-2).

-Difference (Selisih) : The difference in quantity used between H-1 and H-2.

-Price Difference (Selisih Harga): The price difference for the item between the two months.





The purpose of this project is to provide the Finance Department with a clear view of the usage trends for non-food items across different outlets. It will highlight any significant increases or decreases in the quantity of non-food items used, as well as any changes in unit prices. This will allow Finance to identify any irrational increases in usage or pricing, serving as a basis for accountability and further investigation by the respective outlets.


In essence, this analysis helps finance teams understand the reason behind fluctuations in non-food item consumption, enabling them to take appropriate actions, such as asking outlets to justify unexpected increases or decreases in their usage. The project ensures better financial oversight and helps improve inventory and procurement management.
